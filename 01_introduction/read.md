## Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever Makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

- [ ] Download Java
- [ ] Download some IDE (jetbeans?)
- [ ] Run hello world in Java (hardest concept should be diamond operators <>)
- [ ] Learn makesfiles?
- [ ] Learn debugging in the IDE

## Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly-linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them

- [ ] How do I run C?
- [ ] What IDE should I use for C?
- [ ] Run Hello World in C
- [ ] Is there something like a makefile in C?
- [ ] Doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings...maybe I should read a C book for starters
   - [ ] Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from the double linked list of heap-allocated strings
